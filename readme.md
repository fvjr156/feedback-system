# ArciFS - Automated Response Collection and Monitoring System with Microsoft Forms and Power Automate Integration

**Description:** This application is a part of a system that tracks new submitted responses to a Microsoft Forms form, which then uses Power Automate to collect the response data and form answers. This application receives the collected response data, by receiving an HTTP POST request initiated by Power Automate. Then, data is stored in a database, and is displayed and visualized in the app's frontend, allowing the organizers of the form/survey to monitor the responses all while inside the Versatily IT Solutions' application ecosystem.

**Purpose:** The system is made for the STI College Marikina's Senior High School Exposition for the academic year 2023-2024. The intended users are the Expo's organizers which handles the Customer Satisfaction Survey for a certain "Cucina de Marquina", a startup business made by Senior High School students. 

The year's 12th grade Information Technology strand students created this system, alongside other systems, which are planned to be unitively used to streamline processes of the Expo, and to also showcase the skills and creativity of the IT students.
Versatily IT Solutions is a certain IT Solutions provided established by the aforementioned IT students.

The systems created by Versatily for the Expo are the following:

- User Management System
